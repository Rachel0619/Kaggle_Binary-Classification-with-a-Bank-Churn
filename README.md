# üöÄüè¶Kaggle Competition - Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset

## Introduction

The dataset (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Bank Customer Churn Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. 

## Prediction Task

## Original Features
The dataset contains 13 columns:

- Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer

- EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer
- Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)
